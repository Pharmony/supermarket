# Chef Supermarket Release Cadence

Chef Supermarket follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for releases. Major versions (eg. 3.x -> 4.x) will include backwards-incompatible changes or changes that require migration events which may include significant downtime. Minor versions (eg 3.1 -> 3.2) will include new features and bug fixes, but will be backwards-compatible to the best of our ability. Patch releases will contain bug and security fixes only.

## Current Process
Right now the buildkite pipeline is broken, So we are not getting working builds at the required release channel.
But eventually when the pipeline is green we will have builds hitting the current channel and those will require a bit of hand validation.

We need to install the build and make sure everything looks correct and functions properly then we will open a ticket to ops to deploy that to `https://supermarket-staging.chef.io/`

Once that is done and we validate it, We can promote it to the stable channel for on premise customers and raise a ticket to ops to deploy it to the production site.
